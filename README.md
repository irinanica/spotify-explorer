## About

This project was created to showcase the [`Spotify API`](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) searching
features. It creates a tree like structure that allows an
easy navigation through the API response to help the user find more artists similar to the ones they already love.

It is client heavy, focusing on the latest features of Next.js and Redux Toolkit. The Local Storage API is used to mock
the data that would be received through the backend and DB storage.

The UI library used to put this project together is [`Joy UI`](https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/).
